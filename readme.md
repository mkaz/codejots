## Codejots

A WordPress theme to capture notes while coding.

This is mainly something to play around and tinker on a few concepts.

Uses React+Redux and we'll see where it goes...


### Install

You probably don't want to do install this. I recommend checking out <a href="https://github.com/mkaz/jot">jot</a>, it a far more useful command-line utility for taking notes.


### Build

Why would you want to build something, you shouldn't install?
